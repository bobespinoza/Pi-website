Entry 14-Aug-2022: 
</b><br>

I am setting up a Raspberry Pi that I borrowed from my uncle to be a home webserver.<br>

Raspberry Pis are hard to come by these days.<br>
I tried to order one from Amazon but they are all out of stock until around November. <br>
Tom happened to have a Pi 3 that he wasn't using right now.<br>
I am using the Pi OS, as well as a 32GB Micro SD card.<br>

</p>

Here are some sites that have helped me get started:
