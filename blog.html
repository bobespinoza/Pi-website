<br>On attempt one million (it feels like) for trying to get git to push my files to the main branch instead of the master branch.  It is really pretty insane. 
<br>Blowing away all relevant directories.  Will create a new dev directory, and try to do a clone from the main branch into the new directory.
<br>Then will copy the updated file over and push back to git to see if it takes.
<br>
<br>OMG I finally got it to work!!!!!  That took forever, but now I am a little smarter! :)

<br>So, yesterday I set up VirtualHost after I got PHP running.  However, the more I thought about the next step, I would have had to set up a DNS server and redirected the port on my router.
<br>Given that this is an http: site, not https:, I am concerned about opening a window to the outside world through this Pi and into my home network.
<br>I feel like I need to learn a lot more about my router, internet security in general, and what, if anything, it means to the security of my overall network, and home, before I do that. 
<br>Since it is nothing that I really need to do in order to continue to learn about websites, how they link to databases, APIs, etc..., I think I can wait a while. 
<br>
<br>All that to say that I blew away the VirtualHost files and HTML directories that I created yesterday.  They were easy enough to set up to do them again if I want, and I need to figure out if I'm really serious about serving this site up.

<br>I had to blow away my first installation of the Pi today.  
<br>Too many issues with Apache.  I even purged it and the server was still running. (?!?) 
<br>I couldn't get proper file permissions. So I just pulled the plug and started over. 
<br>
<br>

Used the following to get Apache properly set up so that I can read and write the files in /var/www/html

	<br>Hi,
	<br>Its is simple.
	<br>On normal situation, http daemon run as some user and group, www-data on debian (raspbian).
	<br>Standard html files are stored on /var/www/, owned by root:root, with permissive permission, all can read, but only root can write.
	<br>To ordinary user write to /var/www need to takeover it. Supposed the use is pi.
	<br>sudo chown -R pi:www-data /var/www
	<br>Also, need to set user and group permission:
	<br>sudo chmod u+rxw,g+rx-w,o-rwx /var/www
	<br>Now, /var/www can be read,write and chdir by user pi, group www-data can chdir and read. Other not have access.
	<br>sudo chmod g+s /var/www
	<br>Any new file created on /var/www belong to group www-data.
	<br>
	<br>
	</i>
	
	I stopped here, but there are more instructions:
	
	<i>
	<br>
	<br>If have files on /var/www, change user and group, and allow to group www-data read.
	<br>For file chmod u+rw,g+r-xw,o-rwx
	<br>For directory chmod u+rwx,g+rx-w,o-rxw
	<br>Now, user pi can manipulate files on /var/www and httpd can read, but not write.

	<br>
	<br>
	And now...on to PHP!
	<br>
	It's working!!! :)

I am setting up a Raspberry Pi that I borrowed from my uncle to be a home webserver.<br>

Raspberry Pis are hard to come by these days.<br>
I tried to order one from Amazon but they are all out of stock until around November. <br>
Tom happened to have a Pi 3 that he wasn't using right now.<br>
I am using the Pi OS, as well as a 32GB Micro SD card.<br>

</p>

Here are some sites that have helped me get started:
