<br>I had to blow away my first installation of the Pi today.  
<br>Too many issues with Apache.  I even purged it and the server was still running. (?!?) 
<br>I couldn't get proper file permissions. So I just pulled the pug and started over. 
<br>
<br>

Used the following to get Apache properly set up so that I can read and write the files in /var/www/html

	<br>Hi,
	<br>Its is simple.
	<br>On normal situation, http daemon run as some user and group, www-data on debian (raspbian).
	<br>Standard html files are stored on /var/www/, owned by root:root, with permissive permission, all can read, but only root can write.
	<br>To ordinary user write to /var/www need to takeover it. Supposed the use is pi.
	<br>sudo chown -R pi:www-data /var/www
	<br>Also, need to set user and group permission:
	<br>sudo chmod u+rxw,g+rx-w,o-rwx /var/www
	<br>Now, /var/www can be read,write and chdir by user pi, group www-data can chdir and read. Other not have access.
	<br>sudo chmod g+s /var/www
	<br>Any new file created on /var/www belong to group www-data.
	<br>
	<br>
	</i>
	
	I stopped here, but there are more instructions:
	
	<i>
	<br>
	<br>If have files on /var/www, change user and group, and allow to group www-data read.
	<br>For file chmod u+rw,g+r-xw,o-rwx
	<br>For directory chmod u+rwx,g+rx-w,o-rxw
	<br>Now, user pi can manipulate files on /var/www and httpd can read, but not write.

	<br>
	And now...on to PHP!
	<br>
	It's working!!! :)

I am setting up a Raspberry Pi that I borrowed from my uncle to be a home webserver.<br>

Raspberry Pis are hard to come by these days.<br>
I tried to order one from Amazon but they are all out of stock until around November. <br>
Tom happened to have a Pi 3 that he wasn't using right now.<br>
I am using the Pi OS, as well as a 32GB Micro SD card.<br>

</p>

Here are some sites that have helped me get started:
